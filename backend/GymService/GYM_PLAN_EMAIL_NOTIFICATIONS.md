# Gym Plan Email Notification System

This document describes the email notification system for gym plan management in the FitNest application.

## Overview

The gym plan email notification system automatically sends professional emails to relevant parties when gym plans are created or when trainers are assigned to plans.

## Features

### 1. Plan Creation Notifications
When a gym owner creates a new plan, they receive a congratulatory email with:
- Plan details (name, price, duration)
- Gym information
- Next steps and dashboard links
- Professional FitNest branding

### 2. Trainer Assignment Notifications
When trainers are assigned to a gym plan, each trainer receives:
- Assignment notification
- Plan details and gym information
- Responsibilities and expectations
- Dashboard access links

## Architecture

SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_sender_email
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Required Setup

## API Endpoints

### Create Gym Plan with Email Notifications
```
POST /api/gym/addgymplan
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Premium Plan",
  "price": 50,
  "description": "Premium gym access with personal training",
  "duration": 30,
  "gymid": 123
}
```

**Process:**
1. Creates gym plan in database
2. Triggers Kafka producer
3. Sends email notification to gym owner
4. Returns success response

### Assign Trainers with Email Notifications
```
POST /api/gym/assign-trainers-to-plan
```

{
  "plan_id": 456,
  "trainer_ids": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

**Process:**
1. Assigns trainers to plan
2. Fetches trainer and gym details
3. Sends notification email to each trainer
4. Returns success response

## Database Integration

The email service integrates with these tables:
- `gym` - Gym details and owner information
- `users` - User email addresses
- `trainer` - Trainer information
- `Gym_plans` - Plan details

## Error Handling

- Email failures don't affect core functionality
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation if email service unavailable
- Individual trainer email failures don't stop batch processing

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create a new gym plan through the frontend
2. Verify gym owner receives creation email
3. Assign trainers to the plan
4. Verify trainers receive assignment emails

### Email Content Testing
- Check email rendering in different clients
- Verify all links work correctly
- Confirm professional appearance
- Test both HTML and plain text versions

## Future Enhancements

- üìß Plan update notifications
- üîÑ Plan cancellation notifications
- üìä Weekly/monthly plan performance reports
- üåê Multi-language support
- üì± SMS notifications
- üé® Customizable email templates per gym

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Emails not being sent:**
- Check SendGrid API key configuration
- Verify sender email is verified in SendGrid
- Check console logs for detailed errors

**Database connection errors:**
- Verify Supabase configuration
- Check if required tables exist
- Confirm user has proper permissions

**Template rendering issues:**
- Check environment variables for frontend URL
- Verify template data is being passed correctly
- Test with different email clients

### Debug Logging

The service provides detailed console logging:
```
Sending plan creation email to gym owner: owner@example.com
Plan creation email sent successfully to gym owner
Assignment email sent successfully to trainer: John Doe
```

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses are fetched securely from database
- SendGrid API key stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data exposed in email templates
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## Performance

- Asynchronous email sending doesn't block API responses
- Batch processing for multiple trainer notifications
- Graceful error handling for individual email failures
- Optimized database queries for user details
