- **cypress/fixtures/testData.json** - Test data for users, plans, and mock responses

## Key Testing Features:

### üîê Authentication Testing
- Supabase auth integration
- JWT token handling
- Role-based access control
- Session persistence across page reloads

### üèãÔ∏è Fitness App Workflows
- Complete gym subscription journey
- Trainer booking system
- Payment processing with Stripe
- Dashboard interactions for different user roles

### üîß Technical Testing
- API integration with all 6 microservices
- Error handling and resilience
- Real-time notifications
- Caching and performance optimization
- Next.js specific features (SSR, routing, image optimization)

### üìä Integration Testing
- Frontend-backend communication
- Service availability and failover
- Concurrent request handling
- Data synchronization

## Running the Tests:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install Cypress (if not already installed)
npm install --save-dev cypress

# Open Cypress Test Runner (interactive)
npx cypress open

# Run all tests headlessly
npx cypress run

# Run specific test file
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/01-authentication.cy.js"

# Run tests with specific browser
npx cypress run --browser chrome
```

## Test Data Mocking:

The tests use comprehensive mocking for:
- Supabase authentication responses
- API endpoints for all services
- Stripe payment processing
- Real-time notifications
- File uploads and image processing

## Integration with Your Services:

The tests are designed to work with your exact service architecture:
- **API Gateway**: Port 3000 (main entry point)
- **AuthService**: Port 3001 (authentication)
- **GymService**: Port 3002 (gym plans, subscriptions)
- **PaymentService**: Port 3003 (Stripe integration)
- **UserService**: Port 3004 (user profiles)
- **TrainerService**: Port 3005 (trainer features)
- **AdminService**: Port 3006 (admin dashboard)
- **Frontend**: Port 3010 (Next.js app)

## Customization Notes:

To adapt these tests to your exact UI:

1. **Update selectors**: Replace `data-testid` attributes with your actual element selectors
2. **Adjust API endpoints**: Update URLs to match your exact API structure
3. **Modify test data**: Update fixtures with your actual data models
4. **Configure authentication**: Adjust auth mocking to match your Supabase setup

The tests are designed to be realistic and cover real user workflows without modifying your database or application code. They provide comprehensive coverage of your fitness app's core functionality and Next.js specific features.

## Next Steps:

1. Run the tests to see which ones pass immediately
2. Adjust selectors and assertions based on your actual UI
3. Add any specific test cases unique to your application
4. Set up CI/CD integration for automated testing

These tests will help ensure your frontend works correctly with all backend services and provide confidence when making changes to your fitness application.
